        <p>Lane has always enjoyed problem solving. This started at an early age when he helped his dad build an addition to their house and work on family vehicles. Lane quickly expanded his general knowledge base and was hired as an intern for an engineering firm. While there, he went above and beyond expectations in utilization of industry standard software. The mastery of this software lead to that company requesting Lane to speak at their annual conference in Los Angeles, twice. Lane continued his professional development with an Emerging technologies degree at Athens Technical College and is currently working on a certificate of Web Development at GA Tech. Lane enjoys spending time with his family, sports, and woodworking.</p>
